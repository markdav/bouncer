# Bouncer
This is just a working title for a simple javascript game concept.

The objective is as yet unclear but the mechanics are side scrolling shooter with a bouncing ball as your hero.

Todo:

- [] Allow the player to change direction
- [] Add NPCs and Score, etc
- [] Add online multiplayer (might be new game version)
